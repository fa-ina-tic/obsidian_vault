### common similarity metrics used in vector search
1. Cosine similarity
	- measure the angle between the two vectors
	- range : (-1, 1)
2. Dot product / inner product
	- measures how well two vectors align with each other
	- range : (-∞, ∞)
3. Euclidean distance
	- Measures the distance between two vectors
	- range : (-∞, ∞)
