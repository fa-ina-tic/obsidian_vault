Data Structure that enables fast and accurate search and retrieval of vector embeddings

### Purpose
to search and retrieve data from a large set of vectors
it enables us to find the specific data we are looking for in large sets of vector representation easily

in order to search and retrieve data from a set of embeddigs, we need to define a method to compare vectors([[Similarity Metric]]).\

The power of indexs using vector embeddings that capture semantic information is we can instead search the index for approximate matches using [[Approximate Nearest Neighbor(ANN)]]
